## Description
This project allows users to listen music from YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud(soon). Users can search for their favorite songs, create playlists, and enjoy seamless music streaming from multiple platforms.

## How this works
Tune API leverages the powerful yt-dlp library to retrieve data from various music sources such as YouTube/Spotify/Soundcloud. <br />
API seamlessly fetches the song metadata and provide additional data for music. <br />
Retrieved metadata, along with the audio file, is then transmitted to the client, enabling users to enjoy their favorite music effortlessly. <br />
Then music wrapped in iframe for listening.
